## Introducing TwilightTrails

### Think IT!


When I turned 70 I was faced with the lovely euphemism that I was entering my ‘twilight years’.   Well I decided to embrace every last colour a twilight presents and delay the sunset for as long as I am able.  I am not yet ready to let my age determine my possibilities!

Who am I?

* I am a mother and grandmother. 
* I live alone – having been widowed a long time ago.
* I am a retired school teacher.
* I love road trips and being in the bush.
* I have chosen the elephant as my mojo for several reasons: 
  + She also lives into her 70s with strength and purpose; 
  + She is the head of a matriach society (I like that!); i
  + She guides her family herds safely down well-worn paths to favourite watering holes. 

### PLAN IT!

* Step one: I needed a new vehicle that could take me camping.  
 So I traded in my comfortable suburban car for a cheeky little Suzuki Jimny. 
* Step two: Become fully familiar with social media so I can share my experiences. 
* Step three: Equip myself with the necessary camping gear. 
* Step four: Make sure I can change a tyre.
* Step five: Make a flask of coffee, some egg samies, pack the car and go!

### DO IT!

My first road trip starts in a few weeks. 

I have had to swop my new car for a double cab this time, 
as I won’t be alone but will be accompanied by a couple of friends visiting from the USA. 

I have planned a 5 week trip from Cape Town up the west coast and across the provinces 
to the Kruger park and back home via Golden Gate. 
This will give me a chance to check out camp sites, 
availability of WiFi and other necessities before I start my single travels. 
I am ready to go – to prove to myself that with determination and passion, 
70 is not too old to start a new direction, to look for inspiration and adventure in life.
